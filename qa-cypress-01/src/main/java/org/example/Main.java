        First short test with Cypress (cypress.e2e.spec.cy.js)

        1. Visit: https://example.cypress.io
        2. Find the element with content: type
        3. Click on it
        4. Get the URL
        5. Assert it includes: /commands/actions
        6. Get the input with the action-email data-testid
        7. Type fake@email.com into the input
        8. Assert the input reflects the new value

        Given a user visits https://example.cypress.io
        When they click the link labeled type
        And they type "fake@email.com" into the [data-testid="action-email"] input
        Then the URL should include /commands/actions
        And the [data-testid="action-email"] input has "fake@email.com" as its value
